## How to Play:

### Game Rules:

### Game Operation:
* The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies.

* The player can move left, right, up and down using the arrow keys.

* The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square.

* Once the player reaches the water the game is won.
