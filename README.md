# Arcade Game Clone
===============================

Project initially created by Udacity using HTML, CSS, Canvas, and JavaScript to practice using Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript.

This game is played just like the Frogger game. You have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The player has to move from the grass, across the street to the water.

## How to Run: (2 ways)
1. Download/Clone the repository
2. Unzip the files
3. Open the 'index.html' file in the browser

## How to Play:

### Game Rules:



### Game Operation:
* The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies.

* The player can move left, right, up and down using the arrow keys.

* The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square.

* Once the player reaches the water the game is won.



Udacity's Instructions

===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.
